## Tech Stack

This project uses our approved tech stack:

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Auth | Clerk |
| Database | **Supabase** (beginner) or **Convex** (advanced) |
| State | Zustand |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod |
| Animation | GSAP + Framer Motion |

**Database Choice:** Supabase is easier to start (same as Lovable), but Convex is better long-term (real-time, type-safe). Pick based on your experience!

See `CLAUDE.md` for complete guidelines.
